    "In the previous lab, we created a \"has many through\" relationship between `Actor`s and `Role`s using a join table consisting of only foreign keys, the `actor_id` and `role_id`.  In this lab, we will write another \"has many through\" relationship but this time with a join table that contains other information on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with the following classes: `Artist`, `Genre`, and `Song`.  In this case, the `Song` class will be mapped to and serve as our \"join table\".  It will contain its own `id` (primary key), the `artist_id` and `genre_id` foreign keys, and a `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An Artist has many Songs and has many Genres through Songs\n",
    "* A Genre has many Songs and has many Artists through Songs\n",
    "* Every Song belongs to an Artist and belongs to a Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "When properly setup, we should be able to see every Artist's songs with `Artist.songs` and genres with `Artist.genres`.  Likewise, we should be able to see all of a Genre's songs with `Genre.songs` and artists with `Genre.artists`."

The data inserted into the tables can be viewed in the `seed.py` file.  To experiment, uncomment `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` and remove the `pass` command from the function in `queries.py`.  Run the tests and you will be able to play with a `session` object in your terminal!"
